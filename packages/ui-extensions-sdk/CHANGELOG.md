## 0.29.0

### Patch Changes

-   4a58870: Add notification hook

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

-   a9208fa: Remove a bunch of dead code.

    We remove both `AuthStateStatus` and `Host` enums.
    We also remove the `MockLocalStorage` test helper.
    None of these things were used in the codebase anymore.

## 0.27.1

### Patch Changes

-   d8c24b2: Fix custom widgets not validating the feature is enabled.

    For consistency with the other features,
    we make sure that `DDDashboardCustomWidgetClient.updateOptions` validates that the `FeatureType.DASHBOARD_CUSTOM_WIDGET` feature is enabled.
    It's likely that the parent wouldn't allow this,
    but the error message is more consistent on the SDK-side of things.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

-   c68624f: - Remove `RequireKeys` from exports.
    This is an internal helper.
    We don't actually want to export this and have it be part of the public API.
    -   Add `ContextClient`, `DebugClient`, `EventClient`, `LoggerClient`, and `RequestClient` to break cyclical dependency.
        These are not intended to be used outside of the SDK.
        They are only intended to be used internally.
    -   Don't expose underlying `@datadog/framepost` client in `DDClient`.
        We don't intend App developers to need/want to use this implementation detail.
    -   Break dependency cycles on `DDClient`.
        This is entirely and internal improvement.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

-   df17b3f: Create a new package for UI Extensions with the React framework.

    This package provides helpers that make working with the SDK in React a bit easier.

### Patch Changes

-   1f2d674: Bump `typescript` to 4.5.4 and remove from explicit `devDependencies`.

    We move the dependency up to the root `package.json` for consistency across projects.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

-   7e959d1: Ensure full shutdown of requests on framepost client destroy. Additional errors may now be thrown from request handlers in rare side-cases. This should mainly not affect the SDK, but we are bumping the minor version to be safe.

### Patch Changes

-   Updated dependencies [7e959d1]
    -   @datadog/framepost@0.3.0

## 0.24.5

-   ca3c3ae: Import framepost into monorepo

-   11cbf60: Update repository field in `package.json`

## 0.24.3
