# v1.0.1 (Fri Dec 17 2021)

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   9b03834: Add a few react hooks (`useCustomWidgetOption`, `useCustomWidgetOptionBoolean`, `useCustomWidgetOptionString`) for working with custom widget options.

    Dealing with custom widget options can be a bit difficult to get right.
    You have to at least:
    grab the initial options from the context,
    listen for changes on the event,
    unsubscribe from event changes when unmounted,
    and check that the value actually exists.

    These new hooks hopefully make that easier.
    They manage all the intricacies of dealing with custom widget options so the App can focus on the logic that's important.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   409fe6b: Add `--features` option.
    This option allows initializing with a specific set of features.
    E.g. `yarn create @datadog/app --features custom-widget,side-panel`.
    It cannot be used with the `--example` option.
-   031dcb7: Add a `--install` option.
    This option controls whether or not to perform `npm install`/`yarn install`.
    The default is to perform in the install,
    so passing the options is a no-op.
    The install can be turned off with `--no-install`.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

-   1f2d674: Bump `typescript` to 4.5.4 and remove from explicit `devDependencies`.

    We move the dependency up to the root `package.json` for consistency across projects.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

-   47d0bf4: Default `--directory` flag to the name of the example.

    Instead of always defaulting to `starter-kit`,
    we default the directory to whatever the name of the example is.
    People can still override the directory by explicitly passing the `--directory` flag.

-   416f343: Add repository field to package.json
