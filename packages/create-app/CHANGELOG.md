# v1.0.1 (Fri Dec 17 2021)

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

-   1f2d674: Bump `typescript` to 4.5.4 and remove from explicit `devDependencies`.

    We move the dependency up to the root `package.json` for consistency across projects.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

-   47d0bf4: Default `--directory` flag to the name of the example.

    Instead of always defaulting to `starter-kit`,
    we default the directory to whatever the name of the example is.
    People can still override the directory by explicitly passing the `--directory` flag.

-   416f343: Add repository field to package.json
