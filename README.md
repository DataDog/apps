    * Note: the TypeScript examples here and the [`@datadog/datadog-api-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datadog/datadog-api-client) are currently Node.js-only, while Datadog Apps are browser-only. The API Reference is useful to understand the Datadog API, but the examples will need some conversion for the browser.
