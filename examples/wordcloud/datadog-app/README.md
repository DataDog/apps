# Datadog wordcloud widget
Based on https://github.com/DataDog/starter-kit/tree/main with some pieces from https://github.com/DataDog/apps-viz-demo/tree/main

# Getting started
* create Datadog app from app_manifest.json
* from base directory (where this readme is) run `yarn install`
* from base directory run `yarn start`
* add the widget to a dashboard

# TODO items
These are some ideas for extending the app
* The aggregation used in the query is avg, but this could be a configuraiton option
* Similarly the rollup function that condenses the timeseries to a scalar value is hardcoded to take the last value, but this could be made configurable with the same options as top list e.g. min, max, avg, last
* The word cloud has weird redrawing behavior as the widget is resized. I think this is due to a race condition with requests to get data getting responses out of order and overwriting each other. Fixing this may require more react knowledge than I have :)
* Add some display configuration e.g. font, size, color, number of words
* The metrics options are hardcoded in the manifest but it would be nice if users could pick arbitrary metrics to plot
* The overall wordcloud sizing is a little wonky. It leaves a lot of dead space especially when the widget is wider than it is tall. It can also appear very small and hard to read.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
