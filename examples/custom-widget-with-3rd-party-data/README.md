# Datadog App

## Custom widget with 3rd-party data

This App provides a custom widget that interacts with 3rd-party data.
3rd-party data is data provided by something external to Datadog (like your service or another service).
It can be used as a starting point for building out a real-world App on the Datadog Developer Platform.
